# LSTM_on_20newsgroups
This project was developed as a homework assignment for the "Neural Networks" course, focusing on the practical application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal was to build and train a RNN model for text binary classification, implementing a full deep learning pipeline. I had some difficulties with text processing, as it is my first work with texts.

## Dataset
Source: [NewsGroups by SKlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html)

## Technical Stack
Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Core Framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 

Key Libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/index.html)

## Training Results
Training Time: ~6 minutes on RTX 3050Ti 4gb

Validation Accuracy: 94.21%

The model demonstrates strong performance in classifying texts, achieving high accuracy while maintaining efficient training times thanks to hardware acceleration.
